This is my personal study tracker for my A-Level subjects: Maths, Physics, and Computer Science.
I built it to keep myself organised, track my weekly progress, and store my notes and small projects all in one place.

-What This Project Includes:

    Weekly Progress Logs:
       I record what I worked on each week for each subject, so I can see how I’m improving over time.

    Subject Notes:
       Each subject has its own folder where I keep summaries, explanations, and anything I want to revise later.

    Mini Projects (CS):
       Small coding projects and exercises that help me practise concepts I’m learning.

    Clear Folder Structure:
       Everything is organised by subject so it’s easy to navigate and update.

-What I’m Learning: 

    -Better time management and study discipline

    -Organising work and notes effectively
 
    -Applying CS knowledge through small coding tasks

    -Strengthening understanding of Maths and Physics concepts

-Contributions:
This is a personal project, but suggestions and feedback are welcome!
